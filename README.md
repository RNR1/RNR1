### Hi there, I'm Ron 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Template Typescript Node Package](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/template-typescript-node-package), [PHLask](https://github.com/phlask/phlask-map), [PhillyJS Website](https://github.com/philly-js-club/philly-js-club-website), and [URL Shortener](https://github.com/RNR1/url-shortener)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects for good cause, or for community growth
- 💬 Ask me about how to make Typescript happy, or how did I move 1300 records from Tel Aviv to Philadelphia
- 📫 How to reach me: [Here are some methods](https://linktr.ee/ronbraha)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: Before code, I spinned vinyl records in clubs.
