### Hi there, I'm Ron ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Template Typescript Node Package](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/template-typescript-node-package), [PHLask](https://github.com/phlask/phlask-map), [PhillyJS Website](https://github.com/philly-js-club/philly-js-club-website), and [URL Shortener](https://github.com/RNR1/url-shortener)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects for good cause, or community growth
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to make Typescript happy, or how I moved 1300 records from Tel Aviv to Philadelphia
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Here are some methods](https://linktr.ee/ronbraha)
